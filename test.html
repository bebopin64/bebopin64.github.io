          Splash - Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Nothing to read into there! Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me. I wish that shotgun was my penis.

          And that's the wayyy, the news goes! Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark Matter for a crowd this tiny! 'Quantum carburetor'? Jesus, Morty. You can't just add a Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something... Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery. We're gonna have to go inside.

          I don't know man, Italy, Greece, Argentina... Burgertime! It's a figure of speech, Morty! They're bureaucrats! I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty! You have no idea what prison is like here! Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. ...and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together... Get your shit together.
